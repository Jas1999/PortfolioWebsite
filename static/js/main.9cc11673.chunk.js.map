functioning MVPs with varying technology stacks and containerizing them with Docker.\n                    The first was a moblie application for in-depth restaurant review which was built using React Native, Flask and MongoDB.\n                    The second project was a blockchain project for storing medical records, so doctors and patients could access records quickly and have them stored securely.\n                    This was developed using Hyperledger Fabric with ChainCode smart contacts and a Nodejs API along with Firebase Real-Time Database for offchain storage. \n                    The third project was a email plugin for generating automatic custom replies.

I used this data to graph and used to sum the data.\n        This was useful on the banking statements which came bimonthly to improve on this I used the current data to train a Random Forest Classification model with\n        word vectorization, so I could predict the category of a expense. Through this I am able to apply my summations directly on banking csvs instead of waiting for then\n        statements. I enjoyed this project since I was able to apply my knowledge without having a tutorial as a guideline and figure out gaps in my knowledge about machine learning.\n        Along with this this was a project I could actually use which makes a project more interesting to work on.\n        </p>\n    </AccordionDetails>\n</Accordion>\n*/\n","import React, { Component,Fragment } from 'react';\r\nimport './Skills.css';\r\n\r\nimport { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\r\nimport Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper';\r\nimport Grid from '@material-ui/core/Grid';\r\n\r\n\r\nconst style = {\r\n  Paper: {\r\n    padding: 20,\r\n    marginTops: 10,\r\n    marginBottom: 10,\r\n    height: 500,\r\n    textAlign: 'center'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default function skills () {\r\n\r\n  var Language = [\"C/C++\",\"Python\",\"Java\",\"JavaScript\",\"Lua\",\"SQL/MySQL/SQLite\",\"NoSql\"];\r\n    var Technologies = [\"Eclipse\",\"Nodejs\",\"Reactjs\",\"Flask\",\"Firebase\",\"Mongodb\",\"Docker\",\"MatLab\",\"Git\",\"PowerBI\",\"BluePrism\",\"Access/Excel Macros\", \"Hadoop/Spark\",\"Kafka\", \"ZooKeeper\"];\r\n\r\n        return (\r\n          <section id=\"skills\">\r\n\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"row skill\">\r\n            <div className=\"three columns header-col\">\r\n              <h1><span>Skills</span></h1>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"nine columns main-col\">\r\n                <p>\r\n                Through projects, coops and courses I have aquired experience with various technologoies and language\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div> {/* main-col end */}\r\n            <h3>Languages</h3>\r\n            <Grid container spacing={3}>\r\n\r\n            {Language.map(name => (\r\n                <Grid item xs={4}>\r\n                  <Paper className={style.paper} elevation={5}>{name}</Paper>\r\n                </Grid>\r\n            ))}\r\n\r\n            </Grid>\r\n            <br/>\r\n\r\n            <h4>Technologies</h4>\r\n\r\n            <Grid container spacing={3}>\r\n\r\n            {Technologies.map(name => (\r\n\r\n                <Grid item xs={4}>\r\n                  <Paper className={style.paper} elevation={5}>{name}</Paper>\r\n                </Grid>\r\n            ))}\r\n\r\n\r\n           </Grid>\r\n\r\n\r\n          </div> {/* End skills */}\r\n\r\n\r\n          </section>\r\n        );\r\n\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nexport default class Header extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <React.Fragment>\n      {/*generated code*/}\n      <section id=\"testimonials\">\n\n\n            {/* Testimonials Section\n         ================================================== */}\n              <div className=\"text-container\">\n                <div className=\"row\">\n                  <div className=\"two columns header-col\">\n                    <h1><span>Client Testimonials</span></h1>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"ten columns flex-container\">\n                    <div className=\"flexslider\">\n                      <ul className=\"slides\">\n                        <li>\n                          <blockquote>\n                            <p>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is\n                              to do what you believe is great work.
