        Details: `The goal of this project was to reduce the amount of time it takes me to check my monthly budget and organize my expenses based on category. I accomplished this initially by creating a python script that read banking pdfs and with regex to get a pandas data frame. I used this data to graph and used to sum the data. This was useful on the banking statements which came bimonthly to improve on this I used the current data to train a Random Forest Classification model with word vectorization, so I could predict the category of a expense. Through this I am able to apply my summations directly on banking csvs instead of waiting for then statements. I enjoyed this project since I was able to apply my knowledge without having a tutorial as a guideline and figure out gaps in my knowledge about machine learning. Along with this this was a project I could actually use which makes a project more interesting to work on. `

        title: "LSTM Stock Predictor",
        Details: `Created a stock predictor using a LSTM model which was created and trained with Keras and Tensorflow in python, with data being pulled from a API. For this project I used various resources and it I took multiple breaks in it to make sure I was limiting the amount of blind copying needed. I rarely add projects I completed following a tutorial because it is hard to check if you actually learned the content or just copied it. But for this one by using different tutorals I was able to learn various method. Furthermore this project got me to look at stock analysis in more depth and learn more about it.`

        title: "Reddit and Weather Dashboard",
        Details: `The goal of this project was to make a webapp to limit the amount of time I spend on my phone. Along with improving my Reactjs and Flask skills. So using the reddit and open weather API I fetched the information from the frontend to display and have open in the background. To limit looking at my phone for reddit and the weather I made a webapp with Reactjs and Flask.`

        title: "Internet Analysis",
        Details: `This was a group project in my database systems course . I was responsible for the data science component since it was group based. In this I aided in designing and implementing an Entity-Relationship  model in 3nf normalization for internet traffic datasets from Kaggle in MySQL. Analyzed data in Jupyter notebook looking at the correlation and generating questions of what to ask the data. Using the data given I setup a classification for detecting the type of actack occuring in the connection using a DecisionTreeClassifier model.`

        title: "X and Y Plotter",
        Details: `Project created for a project course that taught hardware design skills using a TI MSP430 Launchpad board. Using diptrace created a schematic and PCB design for custom IO. Then solidered parts on to it and wrote the code for the project in C. Project taught me how to solider, debug hardware issues and how to design a piece of hardward.`
