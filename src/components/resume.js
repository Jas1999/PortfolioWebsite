                 Cognizantly was new startup, the company's goal is to find behaviorial analysis of traders to help them improve.
                 My main responsibilty were to was to help develop the main application, which
                 I did this using Reactjs and Flask with Firebase Realtime Database.
                 The application was then containerized using Docker. Along with leading the application developement I aided the data science portion by
                 isolating user patterns and also to calculating other components using Jupyter notebook.

                 Nuclear Promise X was a startup that is attempting to update practices in the nuclear industry.
                 Most of my tasks were related to full-stack web applications, depending on the requirements of the client (mainly Bruce Power) or Nuclear Promise X
                 I would either use Powerapps or Reactjs with Nodejs or Flask  connecting to MSSQL or Sharepoint.
                 Along with these task I designed a Java Rich Client Application using SWT libraries to generate and log documentation files
                 and working on some NLP projects to improve efficient at the Nuclear Plant. Furthermore due to the company being a startup I
                 was able to explore possible development of a Dapp applicaiton using truffle suite with Nodejs as potential project.

                 For this coop I worked on at the TMX location on the floor with the traders.
                 My main objective was to reduce time consuming tasks to make the process of information being transported more efficient and effortless.
                 Todo this I created Python scripts using Webscraping with Selenium to grab data and organizing it to ensure efficiency,
                 along with updating the MySQL server and check the accuracy of record. Furthermore I automated and expanded on past scripts in PowerShell and VBA for Excel Macros.
                 As well with this I expanded on several SQL queries to improve the database structures.
